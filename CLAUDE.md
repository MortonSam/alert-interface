# Project Rules

## Frontend Dev Server

**Never run `npx next build` while the dev server (`next dev`) is running.** Both share the `.next` directory, and a concurrent build corrupts the dev server's webpack chunks, causing runtime TypeErrors. To validate:

- Use the dev server's own compile output (watch for "Compiled successfully" or errors in the terminal).
- If a production build is needed, stop the dev server first (`kill` the port 3000 process), then build, then restart.
